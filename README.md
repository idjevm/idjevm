# Hack-Alumni Website Client

This is a place holder / starter repo for our website for everyone working on the frontend to become familiar with the tech stack and this repo locally. There is some documentation listed here that it would be ideal for you to read some of the documentation, start this project locally, and play around with it.

## Technologies
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

## Dev dependecies
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

_There will be other technologies later on, and we will add them later but this should get you started. Links are included above for you to easily navigate to these tehnologies._

## Project Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the latest version of [Node here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you don't have it yet.
3. After installing npm, from the terminal run `npm install -g gatsby-cli` (This will install the Gatsby CLI globally on your machine)
4. Go to the root folder of this repo and run `npm install`. 
5. Start the server by running `npm start` or `gatsby develop`. This will start the local server with hot realoding enabled which will update the browser on code changes when saving.

You can also refer to this [Gatsby Part Zero Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/) <- This should help you to set up your environment fully, although the previous steps are just a simplified version of the steps on this tutorial! 

After following the previous steps, navigate to http://localhost:8000 and you should be able to see a simple header, with a picture of some Hack.Alumni. This means that you have successfully started the server locally. 


_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool and more in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

There are more changes that will need to be added to this README.md once we start building more stuff in our platform but this is good for a start.
